# Group Project: Begin Wireframes & Software Requirements

## Wireframes
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for 
each page in your application.

### Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website 
without committing any code. Create your wireframe in a digital tool. Whiteboard wireframes will not be accepted.

Provide an image of your wireframes in the readme of your project.

## User Stories

Start out by creating at least 5 user stories for your approved project . The outline/requirements for user stories can be found [HERE](./UserStories){:target="_blank"}

Each story in your project management board, for each project, should contain:

1. Title
2. User Story sentence
3. Feature Tasks
4. Acceptance Tests

Provide a link to your project management board that contains your user stories in your project Readme.

## Software Requirements
Using the [Software Requirements Document](./SoftwareReqs){:target="_blank"}, create a new file within your main GH repo named `requirements.md`. Include in this doc the required information for your software reqs for your project as a whole.

## Domain Modeling
Draw out your entities for each component of your project and how they are related to each other. Determine the relationships between the functions/methods and required components of your app.

Include in your domain model, include the names and data types of your entities.

Do some self-research on domain modeling and create your own diagram that represents your app. Here are some helpful resources as a starting point:
1. [Brief introduction to Domain Modeling](https://medium.com/@olegchursin/a-brief-introduction-to-domain-modeling-862a30b38353)
1. [Domain Modeling](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/)
1. [Domain driven architecture diagram](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/domain-driven-architecture-diagrams-139a75acb578)

Include this domain model in your `README.md` file located in your project GitHub repo.

## Database Entity-Relationship-Diagram (SQL DBs only)

Draft out what your database(s) will look like by creating an Entity Relationship Diagram.
 
Be sure to identify the relationships (if any) between each of the tables:

1. 1-to-1 relationships
2. 1-to-many relationships
3. many-to-many relationships

Also, include in each table:
1. The name of column
2. The required data type
3. Indication if the column is a key (Example: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Composite Key)

Include this DB ERD in your readme, accompanied by an explanation of each table
and it's responsibility in the application. 

## Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for 
group credit**

Submit your project repo with your readme outlined. 

Upon completion of your tasks listed above, notify your instructor for approval of the content. After approval, you may begin coding. All 4 project steps **must** be completed before you may start coding your project.
