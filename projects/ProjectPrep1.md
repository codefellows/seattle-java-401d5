# Group Project: Team Agreement
You will be required to make a Team agreement. This will be used as the baseline
and structure requirements for how your team will run during project week. 

Review and write out your plan for the following. Be sure to label each section explicitly. 

**Communication plan:** How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

**Conflict plan:** What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?

**Work plan:** How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. What project management tool will be used? 

**Git process:** What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it's time to merge?

**Any thing else you feel is important:** expectations around work times, stand-up times(outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

## Tasks
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team. During that meeting the group should review the Team Agreement guidelines and decide on a course of action for items such as communication and conflict resolution. Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn't be a problem. It's important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**, please have everyone's name at the top of the doc. 

Review the team agreement, and as a group decide on which areas each group member should be aware of and which areas are strengths. Put a plan of action together for mitigating any communication issues amongst the team. Submit this agreement in the text field in Canvas, or a link to a Google doc.

This step must be completed and approved before any future approvals will be given. (Example: Your project pitches will not be approved until you have this step completed.)
