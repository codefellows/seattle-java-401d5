## Submission

Respond to this discussion with a question. This can be a question about something you didn't understand or want to know more about from the reading, or it can be a quiz question to test your classmates' understanding. Then, answer one of your classmates' questions. (If you are the first person to post a question, you do not need to come back and answer someone else's question.)
